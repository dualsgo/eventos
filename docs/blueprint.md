## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#4B0082) to bring elegance and seriousness.
- Background color: Pale lavender (#E6E6FA), nearly desaturated from the purple and very bright, will bring contrast without clashing with the theme
- Accent color: Royal blue (#4169E1), an analogous hue for call-to-action highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata' serif for its vintage, slightly formal, readable qualities.
- Simple and clean layout optimized for small-size thermal paper.
